# Miller-Indices-Visualizer
## A GUI based program that aims to visualize lattice planes. 

Miller Indices are a symbolic vector representation for the orientation of an atomic plane in a crystal lattice and are defined as the reciprocals of the fractional intercepts which the plane makes with the crystallographic axes.

The method by which indices are determined is best shown by example. Recall, that there are three axes in crystallographic systems (*except sometimes in the hexagonal system adopts a convention where there are four axes). Miller indices are represented by a set of 3 integer numbers.



Works on Turtle + Tkinter framework on Python.
